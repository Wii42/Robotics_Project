    """
    Class to adjust the speed of the robots to keep the optimal distance to the next robot.
    Calculates the speed factor to reach the optimal distance and sends it to the robot.

    Attributes
    ----------
    client : SocketClientCommunication
        The communication client to communicate with the robot controllers.
    optimal_distance : float
        Distance (in meters) the robots should keep from each other.
    sensitivity_range : float
        Determines how sensitive the speed factor is to the distance to the next robot.
        The speed factor at the optimal distance is 1.0, and the speed at optimal distance - sensitivity_range is 0.

        ----------
        client : SocketClientCommunication

        optimal_distance : float
            Distance the robots should keep from each other, in meters.

        """
        Calculate the speed factor to reach the optimal distance.

        The speed factor is calculated as follows:
        The factor is linear, with a slope of 1 / optimal_distance / sensitivity_range.
        The speed factor is bounded between -0.5 and 2.0.
        This means that the speed factor is 1.0 at the optimal distance, and the speed factor is 0.0 at the optimal distance - sensitivity_range.

        Parameters
        ----------
        distance_to_next_robot : float
            The distance to the next robot in meters.

        Returns
        -------
        float or None
            The speed factor to reach the optimal distance, or None if the distance to the next robot is None.
