Distance Calculator Module

This module provides functions to compute the distance between two robots on a segmented track.
It considers both robots on the same segment and robots on different segments, traversing the
track's beacon structure to calculate the correct distance.

    """
    Compute the distance between two robots on the track.

    If both robots are on the same segment (beacon), the function returns the direct distance
    between them if the rear robot is actually behind the front robot. If the robots are on
    different segments, the function delegates to _distance_across_segments to traverse the
    track and sum up the segment lengths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rear_robot : PositionOnTrack
        PositionOnTrack object of the rear robot.
    front_robot : PositionOnTrack
        PositionOnTrack object of the front robot.

    Returns
    -------
    float or None
        Distance in meters between the two robots, or None if the distance cannot be computed.
