This module provides utility functions to control the LEDs of the e-puck robot
for various feedback scenarios, such as indicating goals, detected blocks, 
robot detection, and which side the robot is following.

Functions:
    set_leds_on_goal(robot): Illuminate LEDs to indicate the robot has reached a goal.
    set_led_on_block(robot, block): Set LED color based on detected block type.
    set_led_on_epuck(robot, has_detected): Indicate detection of another e-puck robot.
    set_led_on_side(robot, follows_left_side): Indicate which side of the track is being followed.
