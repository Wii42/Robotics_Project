line_alignment.py

This module provides the LineAlignment class, which ensures that the robot follows
the outer edge of a line on the ground. The main objective is to keep one of the robot's
sensors in contact with the white ground (not the grey area), making it easier to detect
and follow the line. The class periodically checks if the robot is following the correct
side of the line and adjusts its behavior if necessary.

Classes:
    LineAlignment: Maintains and updates which side of the line the robot should follow.
