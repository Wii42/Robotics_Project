Race Manager Script for MarioKart e-puck Robotics Project

This script acts as a central race manager for coordinating and timing a MarioKart-inspired robotics race
between two e-puck robots. It listens for "start" and "goal" messages from the robots, records their arrival times,
and prints the results, including the time difference between the two finishers.

How it works:
-------------
- Waits for a "start" message to begin the race and records the start time.
- Listens for "goal" messages from the robots.
- Records the finish times for the first and second robots to cross the finish line.
- Prints the start time, both finish times, and the time difference.

Usage:
------
Run this script before starting the robots. The robots should be configured to send "start" and "goal" messages
to the race manager's host IP.
