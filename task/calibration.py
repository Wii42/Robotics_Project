calibration.py

Ground sensor calibration utilities for the ePuck robot.

This module provides functions to normalize ground sensor readings based on
predefined calibration factors for each robot (identified by IP address).
Calibration ensures that sensor readings are consistent across different robots,
compensating for hardware variations.
